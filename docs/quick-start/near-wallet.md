## Try the NEAR Explorer

You can view the current blockchain in real time as well as interactions between users and smart contracts.

Navigate to [https://explorer.nearprotocol.com/](https://explorer.nearprotocol.com/) in your browser to see information on specific blocks and transactions from those blocks. This is a useful tool when you are trying to debug your contracts.
