## Overview

NEAR is the blockchain for builders like you.

You can write, test and deploy scalable decentralized applications in minutes on the most developer-friendly blockchain.

Let us show you how:

- Setup your environment and toolchain
- Explore sample applications
- Build smart contracts

## Getting Started

- Use [NEAR Studio](http://near.dev/) to deploy one of several AssemblyScript sample applications in minutes
- Follow our introductory [JavaScript SDK Guides](/docs/roles/developer/examples/nearlib/guides) to
  - Create an account
  - Authenticate with NEAR Shell
  - Prepare your developer playground (a single HTML file with inline JavaScript)
  - Explore levels of abstraction in `nearlib`
  - Send yourself money (after hacking on our wallet storage to learn how it works)
- Follow our end-to-end guided walkthroughs to
  - [Implement an oracle](/docs/tutorials/zero-to-hero)
  - [Issue a token](/docs/tutorials/token)
  - [Call one smart contract from another](/docs/tutorials/how-to-write-contracts-that-talk-to-each-other)
  - [Test smart contracts](/docs/tutorials/test-your-smart-contracts)


### Application Development

- [JavaScript SDK](/docs/roles/developer/examples/nearlib/introduction): our fastest time-to-market tools for building on the NEAR platform
- [create-near-app](https://github.com/nearprotocol/create-near-app): blockchain-powered web app generator with zero configuration required
- [JSON-RPC](/docs/interaction/rpc): our core API for connecting to the NEAR platform

### Smart Contract Development

#### Using `Rust`

- [Rust Smart Contracts](/docs/near-bindgen/near-bindgen): `near-bindgen` provides improved safety with the Rust programming language for high value contracts.

- [Workshop: MapReduce with Asynchronous Smart Contracts](https://github.com/nearprotocol/workshop)  \
  3 exercises and a challenge that will introduce you to development of smart contracts on the NEAR platform using the Rust programming language.



#### Using `AssemblyScript`

- [AssemblyScript Smart Contracts](/docs/roles/developer/contracts-intro): `near-runtime-ts` is a collection of helpers that make your SmartContracts look a lot like TypeScript while compiling to Wasm for execution.

AssemblyScript is for non financial use cases.
