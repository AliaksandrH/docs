## Overview

NEAR is the blockchain for builders like you.

You can write, test and deploy scalable decentralized applications in minutes on the most developer-friendly blockchain.

Let us show you how:

- Setup your environment and toolchain
- Explore sample applications
- Build smart contracts

## Getting Started

As a developer you have a few options to build with NEAR:

### Application Development

- [JavaScript SDK](/docs/roles/developer/examples/nearlib/introduction): our fastest time-to-market tools for building on the NEAR platform
- [create-near-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-near-app): blockchain-powered web app generator with zero configuration required
- [JSON-RPC](/docs/interaction/rpc): our core API for connecting to the NEAR platform

### Smart Contract Development

#### Using `Rust`

- [Rust Smart Contracts](/docs/near-bindgen/near-bindgen): `near-bindgen` provides improved safety with the Rust programming language for high value contracts.

- [Workshop: MapReduce with Asynchronous Smart Contracts](https://github.com/nearprotocol/workshop)  \
  3 exercises and a challenge that will introduce you to development of smart contracts on the NEAR platform using the Rust programming language.



#### Using `AssemblyScript`

- [AssemblyScript Smart Contracts](/docs/roles/developer/contracts-intro): `near-runtime-ts` is a collection of helpers that make your SmartContracts look a lot like TypeScript while compiling to Wasm for execution.
